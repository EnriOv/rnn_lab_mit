# MIT Lab 1

This is a lab from the MIT deep learning course to create Irish songs using a recurrent neural neural network.

# What I've learned

- What and how recurrent neural networks work.
- What are LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) units.
- Why and how to use word embbeding in the recurrent neural network model.
